What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Empty repository is created ;-)

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
working dir = all files in folder on hd
repository = all files that will be managed bit git
staging area = files on hd that will be moved to the repository
