How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It was amazing. I can see how this tool wil help me.
It was built by the guy that created Linux. Linus Torvalds.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Helps to find bugs.
Fall back to a previous way of thinking/approach.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros: You can save at logic points
Cons: You can over or under save

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Depends on the use case.
Sometimes files are grouped together, in those scenarious it is handy to commit them together.
Sometimes files are all stand alone, e.g. a budget, then it makes sence to keep it isolated.
The usecase will thus dictate.
